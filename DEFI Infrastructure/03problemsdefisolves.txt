# Inefficency
In the third module, we're going to talk about in some detail, the problems that centralized finance actually solves. I've already given you an overview of these problems. But I want to go into more detail. Because in understanding the problems, you see the potential of this space. I'll talk about inefficiency, limited access, opacity, centralized control, and lack of interoperability. Let's take a look. We begin by inefficiency.
Play video starting at ::42 and follow transcript0:42
Think about DeFi in terms of what it can accomplish.
Play video starting at ::50 and follow transcript0:50
DeFi accomplish basically, very high volumes of transactions with very low frictions, which would be an organizational burden. As I've said previously, that to transfer the equivalent of a $100 or a $100 million, that is basically the same thing in terms of ease of actual execution of that transaction. But it goes deeper than that. That the Spark contracts that are designed can be reused. It's not like you're building something and then you have to rebuild it, or have to specialize it for every single application. These can be reused in the form of these decentralized applications. It gives a lot of leeway in terms of what you do.
Play video starting at :1:55 and follow transcript1:55
The size of the transaction is pretty well irrelevant. I will qualify this a little bit. I end that given that the gas fees are so high right now, that does provide a barrier to some smaller transactions. But my opinion, that is a problem that will be solved in the future.
Play video starting at :2:22 and follow transcript2:22
There's no organizational overhead. There is no brick and mortar. There's no layers of middle people. A user can operate within the parameters of the smart contract, and the contract on whatever a block chain it resides. I'm mainly talking about a theorem. But there are other blockchains, not the Bitcoin blockchain, that also can host decentralized applications.
Play video starting at :2:59 and follow transcript2:59
Basically, this is open to anybody. There's no interview that's necessary, there is no checks. This is can be used by anyone. This is a technology of inclusion. It's a technology of financial democracy. Once that contract is deployed, it lives forever. On the Ethereum blockchain, for example. It's there, there's no organizational overhead. This is another attribute of efficiency. Keepers are something that we should understand. Keepers are external participants that are incentivized to maintain a service for decentralized finance protocols. For example, they might monitor the collateral that you posted for a transaction. If the collateral dips in value below a certain point, then they will liquidate your position. They're providing a service and they get paid for it. This isn't automatic. These are our actual agents that are essentially providing the service to a decentralized finance application to keep it running the way it should be running, and to reduce the risk, and they get rewarded for that.
Play video starting at :4:52 and follow transcript4:52
The actual payment that these keepers get is market-based. Think about it as an auction that happens. They are an integral part of this network. This is a general point that within DeFi, it's structured in a way that the users are essentially paying market prices for the services they need. This is a lot different than centralized finance, where you're not paying market prices for the services. I did a wire transfer dollars to euros the other week and I was quoted a rate and I was told I'm such a good customer of the bank that they would waive the fee. Well, the rate I was quoted was not a market rate, indeed it was three percent off the market rate. Again, this is just an example in centralized finance of a bank making a fee on a fairly straight forward transfer of dollars to euros. This doesn't exist in the same way in terms of decentralized finance. There is another aspect that's fascinating, and it's the idea of forking. Let's say that there's a smart contract out there and you've got an idea to improve it. Well, what you can do is copy the code that's public access. All the smart contracts, the code is publicly available and you can make that improvement or upgrade, and launch it. Potentially take business away from the old smart contract that you effectively or copied and improved upon. Think about that it's a deep idea that instead of reinventing the wheel, having to do all of the steps of designing the contract and then improving it, you can actually start with the existing contract, you can make the changes and you've got something better. It is so easy to fork. This basically makes everything much more efficient. Think about a small change that is important, but maybe not as important to invest all the time of building something from the bottom-up. Well, you don't need to build from the bottom-up, you can actually take what is there, improve upon it, and redeploy another smart contract. This is a very powerful idea within decentralized finance. It's also the true that this is a general thing for not just the average smart contract, but decentralized apps also. Again, if you've got an idea for improvement, it's easy to create a new dApp. All of these dApps are forkable. Again, this really helps with the efficiency of the technology. There's a term in my work cloud called vampirism. Because of the open nature of decentralized finance, anybody can just go copy the current technology. Technology might be working fine, but you copy it and perhaps you provide an incentive mechanism for people to switch from the contract that you basically grabbed to your protocol. It's really intense competition because then if there's enough people using the new platform, then the old platform might need to change its incentives. In the end, the users get the best deal.
Play video starting at :9:12 and follow transcript9:12
There's also risks that are associated with vampirism. It could be that, and we'll talk about this in much more detail in the fourth course, that some of these rewards are flawed. It could create a situation where people lose a lot of money. It's also possible that the code is effectively hijacked and modified in a way that leads to additional risks. We'll talk about specific examples of that where a smart contract was taken and modified in a way that led to a vulnerability. This happens, so you need to be aware if somebody is doing this. These protocols are not without risk, and that's an important part of this course.

# Limited access
The second issue or problem with centralized finance is limited access. What do I mean by that? Decentralized finance, I've said this and I'll say many more times, is financial democracy. It gives underserved groups, such as the unbanked and the underbanked, the ability to actually operate in the Internet of value. You might think even within the US that, well, everybody's banked. But they're 18 million people in the US that are unbanked. This is a very significant problem, and the impact for the global economy is very significant. Essentially, DeFi gives consumers access to things that they might not have access to before. It's only a very small fraction of the global population has access to things like credit or debit cards.
Play video starting at :1:33 and follow transcript1:33
The products are restricted in centralized finance, and indeed, the decentralized financial institutions, it's their incentive to go for the most profitable slice of the population. They don't want to deal with the small entrepreneurs, they don't want to deal with the small customer. They'll increase fees or just not be welcoming of them. In DeFi, it doesn't matter who you are. There's no check. Remember I said that in centralized finance, there's the customer, the retailer, the banker, the regulator. There's no labels like that. Everybody is the same. They are peers. It's true that some peers might have more wealth than other peers, but it doesn't matter. Their transactions are treated identically to the transactions for those that don't have as much wealth. There's other things that are interesting and this is very recent in the space of DeFi. Suppose you do have a bank account, and you want to put your money to work and earn some interest. You want to at least cover the rate of inflation, and that's usually how it works. However, in most of the world right now, interest rates don't cover the rate of inflation. When you deposit your money at a bank, you get zero or trivial interest rate that is way below the inflation rate. That means that you're losing real wealth. DeFi offers the following possibility. Well, the question is, why are the rates so low for deposits and why are the borrowing rates so high? A lot of this has to do with all of the fixed costs of centralized finance. If you get rid of the fixed costs, then it's possible to increase the savings rate and decrease the actual lending rate. This is exactly what's happening in decentralized finance. If you, let's say, have a stablecoin like USDC, you can deposit that into a liquidity pool, and we'll go into a lot of detail as to how this works in the third course, DeFi, a deep dive. But you get a reward for actually doing that. A savings rate, and these savings rates are much higher than the bank savings rates are today. Indeed, if you think about what happens in traditional banking, you put your money as a deposit, and you get paid very little interest. But the bank takes that deposit and lends it out. Then the person that gets the loan might deposit some of that in another bank. The cycle just continues and it's called a money multiplier. Well, the same thing can happen in decentralized finance, where I deposit some money with liquidity pool in one particular protocol, and then I get effectively a token from that, that represents my share, my ownership of that pool. Well, I can deposit that token somewhere else and earn interest on it too. Again, we are disintermediating the bank, and it's essentially doing the same thing that a bank is doing, having a money multiplier but within this space. The bottom line here is that you're able to get a rate of return on your deposit that is not as risky as investing in Bitcoin or Ethereum, and have a chance at a rate of return that meets or exceeds the rate of inflation. Again, this is open to anybody. You don't need to be a big player to actually do this. This is a very simple technology. There are many benefits to so-called yield farming. However, you also need to be careful because many are making promises that seem unrealistic and it's always best to go with the protocols that have been out there a while and tested.
Play video starting at :6:51 and follow transcript6:51
There's always a risk to take care of. There's another idea in terms of limited access and it's called an initial DeFi offering. We know what initial public offerings are. Initial public offerings are when a private company goes public on a stock exchange. The stock might have been privately traded, and those that able to trade that stock are usually very high net worth individuals. There's a long process that you need to go after to actually be listed on a centralized stock exchange. That is really not available to most companies. Very small number of companies are listed on stock exchanges compared to the number of companies in general. The reason is limited access. Why would you want to be listed? Well, it's a way to raise equity. It's funding. You can go to the bank, you can go and maybe sell somebody a bond, or you can offer equity. This is fairly straightforward to do in DeFi. Equity has a different meaning. We've got equity, we've got tokens, and we'll go through all the details of this. But the idea with an initial DeFi offering is that we can actually launch a token in a very straightforward way in a smart contract and essentially set an exchange rate or a floor rate on that token if we're the first liquidity provider. This is very straightforward to actually do. Let's go through the mechanics of how this actually works. Let's say we've got a token, we'll call it DFT and it's got an initial supply of two million. What we can do is we can make the initial DFT token worth 10 cents. We'll quote things in terms of USDC, which is linked and guaranteed by Coinbase in terms of its peg to one dollar. Basically, what you could do is to create an initial market where you've got a million DFT in a liquidity pool with 100,000 US dollar tokens. Basically, here's a situation where people are purchasing the DFT that will drive up the price, and you immediately set the price given what you've contributed to the liquidity pool. This is a very straightforward mechanism and quite popular today.
Play video starting at :10:5 and follow transcript10:05
It allows for a startup to instantly come to market. If you think of coming to market with a product, it's so complicated, this is all done virtually. It's all within the smart contract. There are some disadvantages and let me be up front. One disadvantage is that the floor that's set is somewhat artificial. There could be price discovery that suggests this token is not worth 10 cents, it really should be worth five cents. This is not perfect, but it just allows people to innovate very quickly. Again, this is part of the democratization of access and IDOs are one of the components of that democracy. This is a way to deliver user access to have an entrepreneur launch something very quickly, very cheaply, without the traditional baggage of hiring an investment bank and lawyers and all of the fees that are associated with that.

# Opacity
So the third problem of centralized finance is opacity.
Play video starting at ::8 and follow transcript0:08
So let me talk in some detail about this. So traditional finance is transparent to only certain people in particular the regulator. So effectively, what we need to do is to trust that the regulator has got the information that it needs and that the company is actually providing accurate information and that the regulator is very diligent and checking all the time.
Play video starting at ::43 and follow transcript0:43
So decentralized finance, everything is transparent. So the smart contract anybody can look at.
Play video starting at ::54 and follow transcript0:54
So you know exactly what the balances are, of all of the contracts, the players, this is completely open.
Play video starting at :1:4 and follow transcript1:04
Okay, so this is a much different situation than centralized finance where we can't really see this.
Play video starting at :1:14 and follow transcript1:14
So when you've got a smart contract and that smart contract might actually hold a balance. So I gave an example of the DFT token and some USDC, anybody can check the ballots. So think of this as you know in terms of your counter parties exactly how much they have.
Play video starting at :1:37 and follow transcript1:37
Okay, so even in centralized finance, the bank doesn't really know how much capital their client might have.
Play video starting at :1:48 and follow transcript1:48
They can ask but they're not sure, within decentralized finance, it's immediate, So the collateral very, very clear. It's also possible to read the contract. It's there, his contracts are are usually fairly simple so you can determine if the terms are agreeable to you.
Play video starting at :2:13 and follow transcript2:13
Okay, so this is very transparent.
Play video starting at :2:20 and follow transcript2:20
So this also kind of eases the threat of kind of legal Obertan's because it is transparent, it's there, right? There's no fine print, it is an algorithm and every single line of the algorithm is the same font size.
Play video starting at :2:39 and follow transcript2:39
So I think that this is something that in traditional finance, especially the small clients, they get taken advantage of all the time legally by the fine print. And the contract will be very complicated potentially many, many pages and it just seems like too much for a small user to go through and essentially figure out all the details of that contract.
Play video starting at :3:22 and follow transcript3:22
This new space is much different.
Play video starting at :3:27 and follow transcript3:27
However, there's one thing to read a 25 page contract and centralised finance, but another to read a couple of pages of solidity code, so that's one of the languages that's used for smart contracts. So the average consumer probably doesn't understand that code, but again, this is one of the beauties of decentralized finance, it's open source. And there is a sense of the wisdom of the crowd that if there is a flaw in that smart contract, if there's a condition that's not very favorable to the users, then it will be forked, so somebody will take it and improve it.
Play video starting at :4:20 and follow transcript4:20
Okay, so I think that this idea of forking and the transparency reduces the risks of a complicated set of computer code. There is still risk, but it is mitigated.
Play video starting at :4:39 and follow transcript4:39
So another thing is that these contracts are designed in a way to ensure the behavior of the people that are interacting with the contracts, behave in an appropriate way.
Play video starting at :4:56 and follow transcript4:56
Okay, so it might be that somebody has to put a stake up or an escrow and if there's a problem then you lose some of your stake. So it's incentive compatible.
Play video starting at :5:16 and follow transcript5:16
So this is a built in mechanism to make sure that the contract is basically doing what it promises to do.
Play video starting at :5:30 and follow transcript5:30
So staking is a very important thing that we talk about in this course in considerable detail. It is the easiest way to basically punish inappropriate behavior because if you behave inappropriately, the stake is slashed.
Play video starting at :5:56 and follow transcript5:56
Okay, so, and this is again, all built in to the actual contract. It also works the other way where there's incentives to do things that are consistent with the contract. Okay, so it works actually both ways in terms of both incentives and penalties.
Play video starting at :6:19 and follow transcript6:19
So token contracts are really important, and again, there are 100s if not 1000s of tokens that are out there that are linked to the Ethereum Blockchain. And the token contract again is extremely transparent. So it tells you what the money supply rule is. So when we create a token and in my course I created it and the money supply is one billion tokens and that's it, we're done.
Play video starting at :6:57 and follow transcript6:57
I can't change it to 2 billion because once it's in the Ethereum Blockchain, it's there forever. So think of this, compare that to our centralized financial system or our central banks, who knows what they'll do to the money supply, we can't look it up, they have a meeting and decide what to do and who knows what that would be. So, these token contracts really clear what the money supply rule is, how many tokens are in the system right now, there might be a money supply rule in terms of inflation or deflation but it's all built into the contract and anybody can see it.
Play video starting at :7:48 and follow transcript7:48
So it's a much different money system than we're used to.

# Centralized control
The fourth problem in centralized finance is centralized control. How does DeFi deal with that?
Play video starting at ::14 and follow transcript0:14
There is centralized control in almost all of traditional finance. At the very highest level, it is a central bank or a government that controls the money supply. Then if you go down a few levels, you've got these giant firms that are exerting basically a market power over things like banking, insurance, and the exchange of assets. But when we start with the centralized government institutions, they hold effective monopoly power over things like inflation. I know that the link to inflation and central banks is somewhat controversial, but I don't think there's any controversy for those countries that have had to experience a hyperinflation, that central banks can create inflation if there's excessive printing of money.
Play video starting at :1:29 and follow transcript1:29
Decentralized finance is obviously decentralized, that's the name, decentralized. The control is not by centralized players, but by essentially open protocols that are transparent and people understand them, and they also understand that they're immutable. Again, the stakeholders get to interact with these algorithms. There could be a parameter that controls the inflation or the deflation, as I mentioned earlier, and this is built into the decentralized finance dApp.
Play video starting at :2:16 and follow transcript2:16
It's also the case that some of these apps are less decentralized than we might want.
Play video starting at :2:31 and follow transcript2:31
It might be that the applications got some special privileges for an administrator. I guess that that means that it's not completely decentralized, but, and this is important, anybody can see that. We know that that administrator has got that privilege, and any user can basically take that smart contract and redo it, fork it, to a situation where you don't have that centralized data control.
Play video starting at :3:17 and follow transcript3:17
It often is the case very early on, the administrators or the developers retain control for a short period of time, and then they transition to a fully decentralized application and that's very common. But what I'm talking about is something that's been out there a while, there's no plan to go decentralized. If it's a good idea, then we can just take it, fork it, and make it decentralized. This idea of forking, again, is a very powerful idea. If there's a problem, if we don't like the centralized control, if there is some flaw or if there's just something that could be done better, it's easy to grab the code, fix the code, and relaunch and it would be a new application that solves the actual problem. Again, this is really difficult to have an analogy in centralized finance. You're using some interface, you're using the bank's interface and you think, "Well, this would be much better if we could do X, Y, and Z." Think about how difficult that actually is to do for the bank, there are probably tens of thousands of lines of code, ancient code, that is really difficult to change. Whereas in this space, it's really easy. Again, you don't have to reinvent the wheel. You take what's there and improve upon it, and this is the beauty of decentralized finance. With the bank, it's centralized. There's a long bureaucracy that you need the check the box off to get that improvement and the bank offered software, whereas in decentralized finance, anybody can do it and there's a lot opportunity when you do that.
Play video starting at :5:32 and follow transcript5:32
What about the trade-offs? This set of courses, is not just about the opportunities, it's about the risks. For example, in centralized finance or anything centralized, if there is a crisis, you can act very quickly. You don't need to go and get consensus amongst the stakeholders. However, the disadvantage of this it might be an overreaction.
Play video starting at :6:6 and follow transcript6:06
Again, we'll talk about this later on. A lot of this has to do with what the optimal governance is for a decentralized application, and we don't really know, and different protocols or different governance mechanisms. The way I see it, we'll figure out what the best mechanism is and then other protocols will adopt it; it is early on. But the key thing is that we've got security, we've got transparency and it's very easy to do these changes. Again, let me go back to this idea of decentralized autonomous organization. It's really what we're talking about here. We've got, essentially, think of a protocol as it's got a number of stakeholders. Not in a traditional sense, not in the board of director sense or the management sense, it's got people that are invested in the governance and this is a decentralized organization. They don't need to reside in the same location, but they provide some mechanism whereby if a change needs to be made, it needs to go through the governance protocol. Governance is very important, and we will deal with that later in this learning experience.

# Lack of Interoperability

The final problem with decentralized finance is the lack of interoperability. What do I really mean here? In traditional finance it's really difficult to integrate products. Indeed, even within my own bank, it is not straightforward to transfer funds from my bank account to the brokerage that the bank owns 100 percent.
Play video starting at ::41 and follow transcript0:41
Even within a particular company it is difficult to do. We have to deal in general with wire transfers that are not secure and are slow and are costly to actually do.
Play video starting at :1:1 and follow transcript1:01
There are so many solutions that DeFi offers that go beyond what we could ever imagine doing in traditional finance. I want to introduce a concept called DeFi Legos. The idea here is just like a Lego block. You build a protocol that's based upon, lets say, the Ethereum blockchain and somebody else builds a protocol based on the Ethereum blockchain. Maybe it's really simple that it could be a token, so two different tokens. It turns out that's really easy to put those tokens into another smart contract together because they follow the same rules. They're both, for example, ERC-20, so they are compliant. We can put these together and move them around across the different protocols. Even your protocol might have its own token, it is able to house other tokens. This is the idea of interoperability. This is completely different than the pain and the cost and the time that it takes to do simple things, like a wire transfer from US dollars to Euros. This is so different, it happens near instantly and all of these tokens can interact with each other. The idea here is that you can build something and then other people can build on top of what you're doing and you become part of the structure. Think of it as a Lego Castle. You put a brick in and instantly you're connected with all of the other bricks. Is a very powerful idea and completely different than anything that we've experienced in centralized finance. Essentially, we are able to combine existing protocols with other protocols. Indeed, we can create a new protocol by just combining a number of existing protocols. Again, you can't do this in a centralized finance. Tokenization, I've mentioned a number of times already. This is really important. There's so many different layers to it that we're going to explore in the later courses, such as tokens, you can place these tokens in liquidity pools. You can have another token that represents your share of the liquidity pool. You can have a token that wraps another token, so there's many possibilities here. But the key thing in decentralized finance is that all of these tokens can interact with each other because they're based upon the same general protocol. Tokenization is a really big thing. It's one of the most exciting things in this course, because I'm going to argue in the course that we soon will be able to tokenize almost anything. Think of illiquid assets that are not traded because they are illiquid, and maybe it'd be very costly to trade them, but you can actually tokenize them and easily trade them. It might be a piece of art that you tokenize, and many people can invest in that piece of art so you'll have a share of the piece of art, and if it goes up in value, you will profit off from that. It could be another asset. It could be land or something like that, where it's very illiquid, but you can tokenize that. You can tokenize services. There's so many different things that are possible that it opens up the possibility of a number of new assets. Any time you bring in new assets, that's good because it reduces the frictions in the market, it allows people to diversify portfolios in a way that they couldn't diversify before, and essentially it unlocks value. It unlocks value in traditionally illiquid assets. There's a lot of possibility here. It's also possible to bundle the tokens together. The tokens could represent a share of stock. Well, you could bundle the tokens together into a DeFi equivalent of an ETF, or exchange-traded fund. Just think about the way that we progress, went from mutual funds, very costly. We go to exchange-traded funds, which are lower-cost but still are costly. Then the next wave is a bundle in DeFi, that is really super cheap to transact in. There are many, many possibilities here in terms of tokenization, and again, it can be tokenized in terms of a virtual asset, like Ethereum, or it can be tokenized in terms of a physical asset. There's many possibilities. It could even be tokenization of an intangible asset. It can be tokenization of a service. There are so many possibilities here, but of course there are challenges, and let's be upfront. To tokenize a virtual asset is very straightforward because everybody can see it. Everything resides on the Ethereum blockchain, for example. But once we start tokenizing hard assets, then you have to have some trust. We tokenize gold, and the gold needs to be held in a vault somewhere. That gold actually needs to be audited, and there's a cost associated with the audit, and the vault. Some things are more difficult to tokenize than others. There's also potential legal restrictions. If you tokenize with Ethereum, then that doesn't exist anywhere. It exists only in blockchain notes. But if you've got your collateral in a vault in, let's say, London, then you're potentially subject to the political risk that might unfold in the UK. Again, we need to look at this in a balanced way, that there are advantages and disadvantages. My read is that advantages greatly outweigh the disadvantages. There's this other idea of pluggable derivative assets. This is essentially an asset is created with a smart contract that's linked to another asset potentially on another platform. This is again portable through the tokenization. We'll talk about compound in some detail and the DeFi deep dive. We'll go into much more detail as to what pluggable derivative asset is. But I don't want to wait until the third course, I want to give you a little bit of a preview. Let me just talk a little bit about compound. Compound is basically allows for lending, and if you put liquidity in you can actually accrue a variable interest rate. The position is a token in itself, so for example, if the base asset is Ethereum, and you deposit some in Ethereum you get, as a result, a share of that pool, and that share is a new token. It's called a cETH, so small case c with the ETH. That can be used in place of a base asset like Ethereum in another protocol, it's a very, very powerful idea. Essentially, if you think of Ethereum as a token, then this is a token on the token. Again, you deposit your Ethereum, you can earn some interest on that, you get your share of that pool, then you can use that share to do other things. It's collateral in itself. Very, very powerful idea. This is basically what we can do is have effectively, and this is in the true sense, a derivative asset. The cETH is a derivative of the Ethereum. Again, this can be deployed and used to create collateral or earn interest on itself. Again, this is a totally new world where you can actually issue a new token so easily based upon an existing token. There's also this idea of networked liquidity, this is the idea that it's pretty difficult in traditional finance to share liquidity. In traditional exchanges it's not possible unless you're a hedge fund and you've got a thing that's called a prime broker, so this is very very limited. But within the space, it's really easy to share liquidity and there's an incentive for doing that. You put your token in, you get a rate of return. You're thinking that Ethereum will go up in value in the future, you don't want to sell it. But you don't want to not have it go to work. The equivalent with paper cash is to put it under the mattress versus putting it in the bank. You put it in the bank supposedly to earn some interest. You do the same thing with your Ethereum and it allows you to create liquidity in the same way as deposits create liquidity for lending for the centralized financial institutions that traditional banks do today. This network liquidity is important in that it allows us to basically harvest liquidity from the crowd rather than the financial institution that is centralized, that is opaque and a central's got to pay for all of the middle layers that we don't need to pay for in decentralized finance.
