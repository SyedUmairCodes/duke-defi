# Evolution of money
Let's start the first course at DeFi Infrastructure. Well, we'll do actually four different modules. The first module is the history of decentralized finance. It's got a number of components. It's actually interesting that decentralized finance has got rather a long history. It's not just the last few years. We'll explore the nature of money, and this idea that money can have tangible and intangible value. We will give a brief overview of the problems that are endemic and centralized finance or CeFi. We'll go into much more detail on that later. We'll talk about early CeDeFi, so that's centralized decentralized finance, and I'll let you know what I mean by that at the point, and of course, the crypto origins. The second module is DeFi foundations. The third addresses in much greater detail the problems that DeFi solves. The fourth module has to do with the popular myths about decentralized finance. I'll try to go through and explore each of these myths and keep you a better understanding of what actually is happening within the space. Let's start with the first module, the history of decentralized finance.

Evolution. How I really mean evolution? It's been quite a while in terms of decentralized finance. If you go back in time, think about the earliest method of market transaction. It was barter. Interestingly, barter is a peer-to-peer technology. This is essentially the first decentralized finance where we've got peers interacting with each other. But the early barter was very, very inefficient.

You want a cow and you've got two goats, you need to find somebody that's got the cow and wants the two goats. So very, very difficult. Indeed, what actually happened was that a system of credit evolved or gifts, it was called, where you give somebody something and then they would give in return at some other point a surplus of what they actually had. Again, this type of market economy, very inefficient. The main inefficiency was the matching problem. You had to have an exchange that made sense to both peers. Money was introduced and it largely solved the matching a problem. Let's go through the purposes of money, and I put them into two groups. One is a unit of account. This is a way to compare the value of different goods and services. Number 2, which is the most important quality, is a medium of exchange. This allows us to get around the barter that we can use money. I put this secondary, but many people put this primary a store of value. This is the idea that you could sell your good for money and effectively store that value. If you kept your good, it might spoil. It allowed for some savings and insurance. The fourth attribute is a transfer of value. It actually makes it very easy with money to transfer a value or to defer a value. What about the characteristics of money? Number 1, it needs to be durable. Ideally, you can use it multiple times. Coins, for example, are very durable. Paper money or a plastic money as we have learned actually today, that is not as durable, but there's a system of recycling so that the old paper is replaced with new paper. Portability. You need to be able to carry it around. There's some exceptions here that I'll talk about, but a very important attribute is just the ease of use. The third attribute is divisibility. We all know that a dollar can be divided into 100 cents, so fractional units are important also. Uniformity is also an important attribute. Basically, one dollar that was printed last year has the same value as one dollar that's printed this year.
Play video starting at :6:9 and follow transcript6:09
The next one is limited supply. I think, I have a good intuition as to what happens if supply becomes unlimited or near unlimited. We all know the stories of severe hyperinflations, whether it's in Weimar, Germany or Brazil. Where when the supply gets out of control, then the value or the usability of the currency is greatly diminished. Another attribute is acceptability. The US dollar within the US is legal tender for all debts, public and private. That means that you need to be able to accept the US dollar by law. Because that's a very powerful characteristic for US currency. The last one is stability. This is a subtle, a characteristic which we will address in this course. Because cryptocurrencies are, in general, not stable. But the idea here is if the currency is very unstable, then people will look for alternatives. These are the basic characteristics of money. This is an example of the portability characteristic, and people talk about returning to the gold standard, or some people talk about that. Gold is not very portable. This actually shows to move, a lot of gold is extremely difficult just because of the weight of the gold. A little on the security that's involved in moving it from one vault to another vault. Let's do a very quick history of money. We'll start about 9000 BCE with a barter economy. We know a fair bit about this. It's even portrayed in various pictures that have survived to this day. As I mentioned, this was very inefficient. It took a long time but gold coins were introduced about 600 BCE in Lydia. This solved many problems that were caused by the inefficiency of the barter system. These coins actually have value, so They have tangible value because gold, even back in 600 BCE, was used for other things. It was used in the arts as it is today. Indeed, 70 percent of the gold that is used today is used in things like jewelry. Gold actually has a tangible value, whether it's for jewelry or technology or dental work, It's got other uses. Banknotes came from China and Marco Polo indeed introduced the idea to Europe. They, again, have a long history. But this was the first paper currency. This is a special one for me. 1871 is the date of the very first wire transfer by Western Union. This is an example of what it looked like, so that actual paper has been preserved. What I'd like you to notice is the amount, $300. But there's also something else that's interesting in his transfer and that is the fee. Notice the fee is nine dollars, three percent. This is 150 years ago. Even today, we've got essentially the same situation. You swipe your credit card, three percent, you send a wire transfer, three percent or more. It's remarkable to me that we've gone 150 years without greatly reducing our cost. This again motivates where we're going in terms of decentralized finance. Credit cards introduced in 1950 with the Diners Club Card. They've been around for a while. 1967 is the first ATM and that was introduced by Barclays Bank in London. Telephone banking, which is routine today reaches back to 1983 with the Bank of Scotland. Internet banking, not surprising, came from California. The Stanford Federal Credit Union offered for the first time a way to do banking via the Internet.

Contactless payment, this was introduced by Mobil in the form of its speed pass. It's interesting application because swiping a credit card at a gasoline station actually is very risky for the credit card company because often when a credit card is stolen, the first place that's tried is the gas station, and the fees associated with a credit card swipe at a gas station traditionally much higher than, let's say a restaurant, like five percent. Mobil realizing that they could basically give you cash back and still be far better off than if the customer swiped with a credit card. Chip and PIN was introduced in 2005. It's interesting to me given the insecurity of credit cards that the PIN part is largely not implemented in the United States. 2008 is a big year. This was in the depths of the financial crisis, and we will talk about this in much more detail in the course. But in 2008, a famous white paper was put on the Internet by Satoshi Nakamoto. We don't really know who he, or she, or whether it's a group of people that authored this paper, nobody knows for sure, but we do know that this paper was transformational, a highly impactful paper in finance. We will go through some of the details in that paper. To be clear, this course is about decentralized finance and mainly focuses on Ethereum and applications of the Ethereum blockchain rather than Bitcoin. But nevertheless, we will talk in some detail about Bitcoin. It is the first cryptocurrency and a bellwether, and indeed its market capitalization is roughly 1/2 of the value of all cryptocurrencies. This was an important innovation, and we know in 2014, Apple Pay was introduced, a much more secure way to do a credit card because using facial recognition, or a PIN directly, whereas in the US at least people aren't required to use a PIN. The deal that Apple got with the credit card companies was a very good deal because any payment with Apple Pay is much lower probability of a fraudulent payment.

The world of blockchain really exploded in 2020 and 2021. Essentially, all leading banks have blockchain initiatives. They know now that this is not a niche product. This is something really serious. It is a serious threat to their business model. Indeed, the CEO of Goldman Sachs said, "Assume that all major financial institutions around the world are looking at the potential of tokenization, stablecoins, and frictionless payments." They're not just looking at it. They have teams of people trying to figure out what they can do. They realized that they have to reduce costs. It's unacceptable what the costs are, and the competition via the decentralized finance space is after them.
Play video starting at :16:35 and follow transcript16:35
There's also, and we'll talk about in the course, a lot of regulatory risk. But in general, regulators that are at least economists realized that reducing frictions, reducing transactions costs, making transactions more efficient, that's a good thing. There's a lot of things, well, actually almost everything in economics, you can get one side versus the other side. There's very few things that economists agree upon. But one thing that they agree upon is that if you reduce transactions costs or frictions, that's a good thing for the economy in general, for everybody in general. There have been many positive initiatives and indeed, the OCC has granted permission to use stablecoins as a more efficient way of doing transfer, and we will talk in detail about what stablecoins actually are.

# Money and intanilbe value
One issue that comes up a lot is, where does the value actually come from in terms of the cryptocurrency? For example, Bitcoin. Many people believe that the value is zero. The idea is that bitcoin doesn't pay any dividends, it's got no cash flows. It's not backed by anything. It's a computer program. How can it have value? I think that it's really important to distinguish between tangible value and intangible value. Let me explore this.
Play video starting at ::53 and follow transcript0:53
The story that I like to tell my students is the story of the Iraqi Swiss dinar. Maybe you don't know this particular tale, and I will explore it for you. The Iraqi dinar was the currency of Iraq until the first Gulf War in 1990. Now, it turns out that Iraq and Saddam Hussein had outsourced the printing of the dinar. It's called the Iraqi Swiss dinar because the printing plates were manufactured in Switzerland, and the actual production or the printing of the currency was done in the UK. In 1991, at the end of the war, Iraq was split into two pieces. In the South, Saddam Hussein controlled Iraq, in the North the Kurds. Then a number of sanctions were imposed on Iraq. One issue with the sanction was that it was impossible for the UK to export the freshly printed dinars to Iraq. Saddam Hussein had to scramble and develop his own printing facility in Iraq to print a new currency. That actually happened. The idea was that an edict went out from the Central Bank of Iraq, and citizens were given three weeks to exchange the old dinars, which I'll call the Iraqi Swiss dinar, for the new dinar which I will sometimes called the Saddam dinar. This was pretty important, that citizens had to transfer to go to the bank to exchange for the new dinar because if they didn't do this in three weeks, the old dinar would not be legal tender. It would be worthless. Some people basically did this in the South, but this didn't apply to the North. The North was basically separate. There was no Central Bank of Iraq that had any influence there. Basically, what happened was the Kurds in the North just decided to continue using the Iraqi Swiss dinar. To be clear, that dinar, it's got no value, according to the Central Bank of Iraq. But it was used as if it did had value. Now, this is especially interesting that Saddam Hussein in the South, was desperate for money to pay for various things, and they decided to inflate. They kept on printing the new dinars. At some point, the exchange rate was 300 of the Saddam dinars for one of the old unbacked Iraqi Swiss dinars. The point I'm making here is that it is possible to have value even though the currency isn't necessarily backed by anything. This is a recent example, but it's not the only example in history. The Iraqi Swiss dinar continued to be used and it had value, even though technically, it was unbacked by the Central Bank of Iraq. There's many other examples in history. Perhaps the most famous one are stone currency from the Island of Yap in the South Pacific. Indeed, these failed on the portability that I mentioned in terms of the characteristic of currency. But again, these stones really didn't have any fundamental value. But they were used and that economy thrived in its time. The message here is that we need to recognize the difference between tangible and intangible value. Gold, as I mentioned, a gold coin has got tangible value. The US currency, even though it's not backed by gold since 1971, it's got some value in that the government can tax you and you need to pay in US dollars. It's got tangible value because it's legal tender and must be accepted. It's got tangible value because if you violate not accepting the dollar or something like that, then you could be incarcerated. But it's also important to think about intangible value. Indeed, our economy today is built upon intangible value. We used to be a manufacturing economy, we're no longer a manufacturing economy in the US. Much of the value that's created is intangible. Given that we're more than willing to assign value to companies that have no IP research and development, patents, specialized software, trademarks, customer lists. People are willing to assign value there for these intangibles, and I think it makes it easier to make the case that intangible value is very important for crypto space in general.

Let me come to today, decentralized finance is going to enable efficient peer to peer transactions without the centralized institution. We will deal with an idea throughout the four courses of tokenization of almost anything. This goes well beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Hint the possibility of an efficient barter mechanism. Again, remember this, that one of the themes in this course is that decentralized finance actually opens up the possibility of returning to barter, but in a much more efficient way. Next, we'll talk about some of the problems with decentralized finance.

# Overview of CeFi problems
Now what I want to do is to give a very brief overview of some of the problems with centralized finance or CeFi. It's very brief because we will go through in much greater detail later in the course these problems one by one. But I want to introduce the problems. What's the reason for this? You've got a new technology. The new technology to be viable has to solve problems. It's not particularly useful to solve a problem that doesn't exist or a problem that might exist in the future. It's much more credible to actually address the problems that we deal with right now. Let me go through some of these problems. There are five that I focus on. There are more, but these are five that are important. Centralized control, limited access, inefficiency, lack of interoperability, and opacity. Again, I just want to do an overview and we will get back to each of these in much greater detail. To centralize control, our banking system is highly concentrated. It's interesting that it's not as concentrated as, let's say, in Europe or Canada, but it is concentrated. Our large banks have significant influence. Central national banks, like the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England, also have control over the fiat currencies. There's concentration in other areas too. There's non-financial centralization that you could argue is linked to finance. Amazon and retail, Facebook, Google, and digital advertising. These are firms with enormous market power. These are firms that are, at least we know for one of them, Facebook, very interested in investigating cryptocurrency. It makes sense for them. Given the amount of business that they actually do, that it comes down to a credit card to save that three percent is a big deal. Limited access, again I'll talk in more detail about this. But there are 1.7 billion people that are unbanked. There's probably more than that are underbanked. Our financial system, even though it's been operating in its current form for a little over a 100 years, a lot of people are left out. As I'll go through a little later, this means that many entrepreneurs are forced to use a credit card to get financing for their business. We know what those credit card rates are. Like 20 percent or more. That can't be a good thing. Number three is inefficiency and we've talked already about the three percent swipe. Look, don't fool yourself by saying, well, I don't pay the three percent, it's the retailer that does. Well, that's pretty naive because that three percent makes its way into the price that you're actually paying or part of the three percent. I talked about the inefficiency of a wire transfer or the two day settlement when you buy a stock, that just seems unacceptable in the age of the Internet. Transfer is slow, it's fraud. Credit card companies might say, "Well, we have to charge three percent because we need to spend that money on security. We will guarantee if somebody steals your card and uses it, we'll pay you back. You're not affected, there'll be a chargeback." Essentially you're paying that three percent because they've got a flawed technology, you're subsidizing a flawed technology. It's also no possibility of microtransactions, which I'll talk about also. It's interesting in this space. It's also difficult to get paid. We take a paying on the Internet with a credit card its much more difficult to receive funds. There are some Fintech technologies that are allowing people to do this, but those technologies largely use the centralized finance backbone. Lack of interoperability. Our institutions are highly siloed. To do something really simple, like move some money from my bank to my Robinhood account, that's going to take two or three days. Let's say I want to buy something like a stock on Robinhood or some other broker platform and I want to do it quickly. Well, it's really difficult to do quickly because I have to transfer the money using decentralized system and it's going take two or three days. Again, it is frustrating in the age of the Internet that it would take so long to do this.

Some of these companies recognize that this is a problem and there had been efforts, for example, visa attempted to acquire Plaid. Plaid is a fintech platform that links to make things more interoperable. But interestingly enough, that transaction was blocked by the regulators. The last thing is opacity. There's very little transparency. You go to the bank, you see one bank advertising a savings rate or a CD rate that is much higher than the other bank. Well, maybe they're doing that because they're in distress, that they're just risky, and it's really hard for customers to figure out the risk of the actual bank. Indeed, what we have to do is to rely upon regulation. Thousands of people that are inspecting the banks. So it's not out in the open and that's what DeFi actually does. I'm going to argue that these frictions, these problems cause missed growth opportunities. This is very much related to some of my academic research. The idea is really simple. The entrepreneur goes to the bank with a great idea and it might be 25 percent return on investment. Very exciting idea. They need a loan, but the bank's not interested because the bank would rather deal with a very large customer, rather than dealing with many small customers. The entrepreneur might have a relationship with the bank and the bank says, well, we will boost your credit limit on your credit card and you can borrow the money on the credit card. That rate could be 24 percent. When you think about it, the return on investment,25, the cost of capital, 24 percent. What happens? The project is not pursued.
Play video starting at :8:56 and follow transcript8:56
That is really damaging for the economy. All economies need economic growth. Indeed, many economies are greatly indebted. The amount of government debt divided by, let's say, GDP for many countries is at an all-time high, or at least an all-time non wartime high. That debt needs to be paid back. There are three ways to do that.
Play video starting at :9:35 and follow transcript9:35
One way is to raise taxes and we know that raising taxes is not going to be particularly stimulative for economic growth. Another way is just to print money and we know how that turns out with inflation, which is a tax on everybody, but there's a third way. The third way is increased economic growth. We've been stuck in the US with a two percent growth rate. Europe is one percent. Japan is less than that, effectively zero. But if you have increased growth, then it's much more likely that you can pay back your debt without raising tax rates. Just the economic growth, the increased revenues are generating more tax inflow for the government to pay down debt. This is really important in that the current economic system is basically locking us in to a low growth environment that the project that the entrepreneur has got that delivers 25 percent. That is the project that we can boost GDP growth to five percent, six percent, seven percent. But those projects just aren't profitable given the financial system that we've got. The basic idea is that there should be equality of opportunity. Right now, we've got inequality of opportunity. Certain powerful firms get the best possible deals.
Play video starting at :11:37 and follow transcript11:37
That just doesn't seem right on multiple dimensions, including the economic dimension. That project should be financed based upon the quality of the idea and the soundness of the execution plan.
Play video starting at :11:58 and follow transcript11:58
There are many other issues that are under this rubric of inequality of opportunities. Many in the world have no access to the Internet to do commerce, whether it's the buy or sell. Many of the unbanked. This is also a big loss for economic growth. Where we're going is to establish a technology that is inclusive, that allows for equality of opportunity.

# Early CeDeFi
Let me tell you a true story about early centralized decentralized finance. It's a good story because it's got some aspects a peer to peer. And it really presages the rise of decentralized finance.
Play video starting at ::24 and follow transcript0:24
So this comes under the category of Fintech and this is a project that I was involved with in 2001.
Play video starting at ::34 and follow transcript0:34
So this is the problem that considered the foreign exchange market. So we've got one company or person Alice who needs to buy €100 million euros at the end of September to pay for a machine.
Play video starting at ::52 and follow transcript0:52
So Alice goes to her bank and the bank quotes a rate in terms of the exchange of dollars for euros for the end of September.
Play video starting at :1:6 and follow transcript1:06
Now there's somebody else that's also a customer with the bank Carol and she needs to actually sell €100 million and translate them into dollars at the end of September.
Play video starting at :1:23 and follow transcript1:23
So carol goes to her bank and the bank quotes her rate and it's a different rate, even though this happens at the same time. The rate this quoted Alice and Carol are different and the difference in the rate is called the spread and this is the bank's profit and it can be very substantial.
Play video starting at :1:52 and follow transcript1:52
So 20 years ago a simple idea was formed.
Play video starting at :2: and follow transcript2:00
So Carol and Alice use the same back. So why not just put them together?
Play video starting at :2:8 and follow transcript2:08
This is very powerful because if you put them together, you eliminate the spread. So Carol is better off and Alice is better off.
Play video starting at :2:20 and follow transcript2:20
And indeed, if you think about the network implications, many people have banking relationships with different banks.
Play video starting at :2:31 and follow transcript2:31
So it might be that we could actually have this work across many different banks and to make it worthwhile for the bank. They will handle the credit quality evaluation and we'll give them a small fee, but the spread is gone, and this fee is nowhere near as much as the spread. Okay, so to be clear, this is really good for Carol, it's really good for Alice, but the bank is going to take a hit as a result.
Play video starting at :3:11 and follow transcript3:11
So this is the story of this project. Indeed, on the front cover of Euro money magazine, it was one of the very first decentralized finance applications.
Play video starting at :3:28 and follow transcript3:28
And you can see the network diagram and how this actually worked to match customers of a bank or all participating banks.
Play video starting at :3:40 and follow transcript3:40
So now, what I'd like you to think about is going to the senior management of the bank or the board of directors and making a pitch for this new technology.
Play video starting at :3:52 and follow transcript3:52
So we're basically asking you to spend money on this new technology to match your customers and it will, when you do that, you'll get paid a small fee, but your spread is gone, okay? So the pitch is effectively pay us the money to implement this strategy and it will greatly reduce your profit.
Play video starting at :4:25 and follow transcript4:25
So you're spending money to effectively lose money.
Play video starting at :4:30 and follow transcript4:30
So you can imagine that is a pretty difficult pitch.
Play video starting at :4:36 and follow transcript4:36
But even at this time, 20 years ago, the banks realize that this just is not sustainable.
Play video starting at :4:46 and follow transcript4:46
The customers are upset that they have to pay the spread when it's really clear that there is technology that exists today to match the customers.
Play video starting at :5:1 and follow transcript5:01
So we even though a very tough kind of cell or spend some money to reduce your profits. The banks realized that they had to make innovations like this or customers would seek non bank solutions within the context of Fintech.
Play video starting at :5:24 and follow transcript5:24
So this is not the only early application of peer to peer sort of transactions. So the previous application was peer to peer within a bank. This idea of dark pool trading actually began in 1979. So it used to be for a particular stock, you had to trade on a particular exchange where it was designated, so effectively imposing monopolistic power by that exchange. But the emergence of dark pools allowed in particular large kind of asset managers to trade amongst peers in an off exchange sort of method. And today, interestingly about half of all stock trading doesn't occur on the traditional exchanges, like the New York Stock Exchange.
Play video starting at :6:30 and follow transcript6:30
There of course are other sort of players that have emerged in the Fintech space. So PayPal was founded in 2000 as a way to speed up payments. A number of banks have have implemented Zell, which is the payment mechanism, but this is really important to understand, I'm going to emphasize this multiple times in the course. These payment initiatives, well, they improve the user experience and are good and that they improve the user experience. They can only go so far, they can only go so far because they are using the legacy banking structure and that banking structure will be disrupted with decentralized our finance.

# Crypto oriins
So now let me talk about the origins of crypto.
Play video starting at ::7 and follow transcript0:07
So the key innovation was this idea of Blockchain technology and that innovation actually happened well before Bitcoin was introduced. So Haber and Star Netta published a paper in the journal Cryptology In 1991 outlining the idea of Blockchain and the application in their paper was the time stamping of documents.
Play video starting at ::41 and follow transcript0:41
So that paper kind of sat around for quite a while, nothing really happened. But there was another idea that arose and Adam back in 2002 essentially invents this idea a proof of work and we'll go into considerable detail as to what that is.
Play video starting at :1:8 and follow transcript1:08
So the idea is that at the time there was a lot of junk email it was a real play and the internet being a free good basically encouraged certain people to do spamming.
Play video starting at :1:29 and follow transcript1:29
And the idea was that what about if we have a different system we have to do a little bit of work. So you run a computer program before you send the email.
Play video starting at :1:45 and follow transcript1:45
And for most of us this would be just no big deal. It would so instead of the email going in one second, it takes two seconds, take two seconds.
Play video starting at :1:57 and follow transcript1:57
So this of course had different implications if you're sending millions of emails. So instead of just pushing them out, you have to invest in all of this work. And this work basically would make it infeasible to doh the spamming. So a number of people were working on this, Dwork and Naor also in 1992 this was like a big problem.
Play video starting at :2:30 and follow transcript2:30
So these two ideas of doing some work before you actually send the email. So effectively the email becomes costly, a very low cost for one but a high cost for millions. And this idea of a Blockchain which will explore in some detail in a few minutes.
Play video starting at :2:54 and follow transcript2:54
These ideas were joined and this famous white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and Bitcoin was introduced and it's introduced as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.
Play video starting at :3:15 and follow transcript3:15
And it's interesting, we will talk again about those throughout the course that the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto was that this would be a transaction a mechanism.
Play video starting at :3:29 and follow transcript3:29
Indeed, the very first retail transaction with Bitcoin was that somebody spent, it was 10,000 Bitcoin for two Pizzas.
Play video starting at :3:41 and follow transcript3:41
Okay, so so that was the original vision that vision has not obtained. Bitcoin has been very successful but it's been more successful as a store of value or something that's useful for very large scale transactions. Nevertheless, the idea is a great idea and many people got energized with this idea and decided that this was the foundation that they could actually build upon.
Play video starting at :4:15 and follow transcript4:15
So what about the basic attributes here?
Play video starting at :4:22 and follow transcript4:22
So there were plenty of digital currency ideas in the 1980s. So it seemed inevitable that we would have a digital currency but there was a big problem and there are maybe 100 of these companies and almost all of them failed.
Play video starting at :4:45 and follow transcript4:45
And the reason was really simple that a digital currency is not that much different than let's say a digital photo. A digital video digital music, you can make a perfect copy so you can spend more than once.
Play video starting at :5:9 and follow transcript5:09
So the idea that Satoshi Nakamoto had eliminated the possibility of spending more than once using Blockchain technology. This is the so called double spend problem with Blockchain technologies will see there's a record of all transactions, it's completely open. So if somebody is spending you can check the Blockchain record to see if they had the coin to actually spend.
Play video starting at :5:45 and follow transcript5:45
Okay so it's easily verified it's completely transparent and very very fast.
Play video starting at :5:52 and follow transcript5:52
So this information is kept in this ledger and the ledger or Blockchain is immutable. And that's really important to because you don't want a adversary going and changing history. So mutability means that once it goes into this ledger it's there forever.
Play video starting at :6:17 and follow transcript6:17
It's also distributed amongst many different computers. And I'll show you in a few minutes what that actually looks like. So it is a redundant technology where the same ledger that shows who's got what. And all of the transactions that is basically replicated on many different computers or as we call them in a network notes.

And the original idea in the Bitcoin paper was algorithmic scarcity. So the total production of Bitcoin was capped at 20 one million. Today we have approximately 18 million. And the last Bitcoins will be produced in the year 2140.

So it's also the case that this technology has got user ssovereignty,which means that you decide you're the person that decides if you spend nobody else can do it for you.

And the last aspect was portability and we talked earlier about how difficult it is to let's say carry around gold in any size.
Play video starting at :7:37 and follow transcript7:37
It's also difficult to do a wire transfer. It goes from bank the bank, the bank especially international transfer.
Play video starting at :7:46 and follow transcript7:46
So this is a completely different idea, there's no physical transfer in crypto. A transaction basically goes onto this Blockchain record and it is propagated throughout the entire network.
Play video starting at :8:10 and follow transcript8:10
Everybody's got the same ledger and that's just how it works. There's no physical transfer of anything. The record, this immutable record says that you own the coin and it doesn't matter where you are and it's very fast and secure. So this is a great idea, so let's think about this versus fiat currency. So and I kind of mentioned this already that the US currency has got a number of attributes like the government's ability to tax you and you have to pay in US dollars. The legal tender as well as as I mentioned incarceration if you don't pay your taxes and US dollars. Okay, so it's also the case that economic conditions impact the value of the dollar.
Play video starting at :9:14 and follow transcript9:14
And of course it's also possible that the Federal reserve could choose to inflate by printing excessive amount of currency. Okay, so this is a completely fiat and crypto very very different. So you've got scarcity that is hard coded into the algorithm.
Play video starting at :9:41 and follow transcript9:41
So it's unthinkable to even speculate about some agreement to raise the cap on the number of Bitcoin. So why would people vote for that that own Bitcoin? Because as soon as that happens, the value of what they're holding would go down.
Play video starting at :10:5 and follow transcript10:05
So there is no link with economic activity but let's be careful about that. So it's really clear that the main fiat currencies are linked to the state of the economy. And if you've got an algorithm like Bitcoin or ethereum, it's just not clear that there's theoretically any link. But nevertheless, given that Bitcoin is now a risky a store of value, it is sensitive, too risky events. So for example, in March 2020 when the stock market plunged because of the covid 19 scare Bitcoin dropped by 55%. When people became a little more comfortable that we'd emerge from the crisis, the stock market went up, and so did Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. So Bitcoin is important, it is the flagship. We will talk about Bitcoin in this course via something that's known as wrapped Bitcoin. That is something that is traded in the decentralized finance space in the ethereum Blockchain. So ethereum is founded by Metallic in 2015, it is a different technology than Bitcoin. So Bitcoin essentially allows you to transfer from one account to another account.
Play video starting at :11:41 and follow transcript11:41
The ethereum can do something else. It can run a small computer program and this is known as a smart contract.
Play video starting at :11:52 and follow transcript11:52
So you can think of ethereum has a distributed computational platform. Remember, I said that in Bitcoin, all of the transactions are preserved in every single copy of the Bitcoin Blockchain on every single note. This is also true for the smart contracts. When that program runs on one node it will run on all of the notes. So again this is redundant but this is a very important feature of this network.
Play video starting at :12:26 and follow transcript12:26
Okay, so essentially with Bitcoin you can interact with other, let's say, accounts other people or institutions with transfers. But in ethereum you can actually interact with a smart contract, so that's really special. And ethereum is the backbone of decentralized finance because most of decentralized finance uses the smart contract method. So we'll talk about decentralized applications which short form are adapts. So what is the adapt so you're probably most familiar with just a regular app on your smartphone. And those apps are basically you interacting with a centralized party, and that centralized party has got an incentive for to provide the service to you. And it might be they push advertising to learn about you, and other things.
Play video starting at :13:44 and follow transcript13:44
So a decentralized app is an app that puts people together as peers. So you interact through a smart contract.
Play video starting at :13:59 and follow transcript13:59
But there is no centralized institutions, it's just an algorithm.
Play video starting at :14:5 and follow transcript14:05
Okay, so think of the smart contract as the algorithm, there's no board of directors, there's no headquarters necessarily. So it's a very powerful idea that allows for peer to peer.
Play video starting at :14:21 and follow transcript14:21
So, as I mentioned at the beginning, this is a technology that creates a competitive marketplace for financial depths.
Play video starting at :14:35 and follow transcript14:35
And we will talk about the primitives in the second course that includes exchange lending, tokenization as well as other things.
Play video starting at :14:48 and follow transcript14:48
The other thing that's interesting with these depths is the network effect.
Play video starting at :14:54 and follow transcript14:54
Okay, so there is a way that is very natural and decentralized finance of combining and recombining different DeFi products. And there's also in a way to offer incentives to get people to actually use a particular protocol that's much different than what we're used to in traditional finance.
Play video starting at :15:22 and follow transcript15:22
Okay, so this is the end of the first module. And the next thing that I want to do is to talk about the foundations of DeFi. I've talked briefly about Blockchain go into much more detail, cryptocurrency smart contracts, oracle stable coins and decentralized applications
